===================

One way synchronization script from Zendesk to Trac

This is a modified version of email2trac script. Using it and a few other tools you can get information from your Zendesk tickets to your Trac. The idea is that Zendesk emails it to some email account and then email2trac parses it into Trac. It will provide only a limited functionality - sync comments, attachments, some fields. It may be quite hard to get working for novice users.

See INSTALLATION.txt for setup details.
